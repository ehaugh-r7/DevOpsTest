# Environment Variables and Secrets

The pipelines in this Repo use a number of environment variables and secrets to ensure consistency and expected behavior.

These can be set while configuring the pipeline within Azure Devops at the Review stage, or alternatively set and updated after the pipelines creation

## Environment Variables and Secrets used:
1. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID & AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- API Key credentials of an AWS User - enabling the pipeline to interact with AWS ECR for running mimics in docker
- Can be generated by navigating to the AWS Console > IAM > Users > Create User if necessary > Security Credentials > Create Access Key
2. BASE_URL & API_KEY
- The ICS environment to save scans to and a corresponding API Key to enable interaction without authentication
- The Base URL can be found through ICS > Settings Icon > System Administrator > System > Base URL
- An API Key can be generated by ICS > Settings > User Management > API Keys > Add API Key
3. IAC_TEMPLATE_DIR_PATH
- The relative directory path from the root where IaC Templates are defined
